# Lab 3: Create an approval flow with Copilot in Power Automate

In this exercise, you'll create an automation by using Copilot in Power Automate to automate the approval process for a real estate showing. 
You'll use Copilot to create a flow that sends an email to the real estate agent when a new showing is requested. 
Then, the agent can approve or reject the showing request from within the email.
