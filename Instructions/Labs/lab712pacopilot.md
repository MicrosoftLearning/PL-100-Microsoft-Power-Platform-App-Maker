# Create Automated Processes with Power Automate and Copilotâ€‹
## Part 1: Create a cloud flow with Copilot in Power Automate

In this lab, you'll create an automation using Copilot in Power Automate to send an email when an expense report is created. Expense report is a Microsoft Dataverse table. You will use Copilot in Power Automate to help build the initial flow and make revisions to get to your desired flow design.

### Exercise 1: Create a flow with Copilot
Follow these steps to create a flow using Copilot.

1. Sign in to Power Automate at `https://make.powerautomate.com` using the credentials provided to you on the **Resources** tab.

1. Enter the following text into the Copilot chat window and then press the **Enter** key on your keyboard:

   `Add "A new expense report called (Report Name) has been created." as the Body parameter for the Send an email action.`

   The **Body** field should populate with the prompt text.
